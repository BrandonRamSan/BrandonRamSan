# ðŸŒŽ Hello World!
My name is Brandon Ramirez Sanchez, and this is my GitHub profile!

## ðŸŽ“ What I am now
* I am a university student in my second year of pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, as well as a minor in Data Analytics.
* So far I have learned **basic C++** in my programming courses, as well as **introductory knowledge on Database Constructs and the SQL language**.
* I have always been fascinated by technology, especially the automation of tasks
  - Whether it be having calendar notifications on my phone go off or asking a voice assistant to tell me the weather and play my favorite podcast when I wake up, I'm fascinated by the process behind it all.

## :grey_question: What I want to be
* I am aspiring to be a software engineer
  - Regardless of where I end up, my goal is to make all kinds of technology accessible to more people in order to help those who need it most.

## :grey_exclamation: What I'm doing to get there
* In this upcoming Spring semester at my university I am learning about data structures and algorithms and scientific visualization
* However in my free time, I am taking a couple courses provided by Harvard on edX's website, such as CS50X and CS50P to cover any gaps I may have in my skills as a programmer.
* When I gain more confidence in my abilities I also plan to share projects on here for any critique or inspiration to others who need it!
